# Convex development lifecycle

## Supported setup

Use Node 22+ and the repository's pinned pnpm 10.20.0. Install with `pnpm install`; Convex 1.43.0, `convex-test` 0.0.60 and its Edge Runtime peers are exact versions in `packages/api/package.json` and `pnpm-lock.yaml`.

Run `pnpm --filter @learn-anything/api convex:dev` from the repository root (equivalent to `npx convex dev` in `packages/api`). It attaches only a development deployment, pushes checked-in schema/functions and regenerates `packages/api/convex/_generated/` typed bindings. The generated bindings are committed because the offline CI typecheck and `convex-test` suite need them without deployment credentials; regenerate and commit their diff whenever Convex functions or schema change.

## Synthetic reset and migration checks

Automated tests never call Convex or the network; they use in-memory `convex-test`. Run the reset twice and compatibility/retry checks with:

```sh
pnpm test -- packages/api/tests/schema-lifecycle.test.ts packages/api/tests/projects.test.ts
pnpm test -- packages/api/tests/schema-lifecycle.test.ts packages/api/tests/projects.test.ts
```

Bootstrap first records a cursor, then a retry writes one version marker and completes. `checkCompatibility` requires the committed schema and function versions. Future data changes must be additive/optional, ship a bounded indexed resumable internal migration with a cursor, test retry and old/new compatibility, then tighten fields only after completion. Do not use SQL migrations or unbounded `.collect()` in production functions.

## S04 project and conversation schema

Schema/function version 2 adds `projects`, `learningGoals`, `learningSessions`, `messages`, and `progressEvents`. Document, ingestion-job, and chunk tables are deliberately deferred to S08/S09/S10: they are not placeholders in this release because their storage, upload and retry contracts are not ready. A project is the root scope (its Convex `_id` is its `projectId`); every child record repeats `ownerId` and `projectId`, and mutations verify both the referenced project and session before writing.

`projects.by_owner` supports an owner's project list. Each child table's `by_owner_project` supports its scoped list and bounded cleanup; sessions add `by_owner_project_session_key` for idempotent session creation; messages add `by_owner_project_session`, `by_owner_project_turn`, and `by_owner_project_idempotency` for a session transcript, stable turn lookup, and retry deduplication. `turnId` and `idempotencyKey` are client-generated stable opaque strings; `createdAt`, `endedAt`, and `deletedAt` are generated inside Convex mutation handlers with the server's `Date.now()`, never accepted from the caller.

S04 exports internal-only example mutations while S05/S06 establish `ctx.auth` identity. Their explicit `actorUserId` is a testable server-caller contract, not a public authorization path; no public function is exposed that trusts it. S05 must replace the placeholder with `ctx.auth.getUserIdentity()` and retain the ownership checks.

Project deletion is two phase: `requestProjectDeletion` soft-deletes the root immediately, then bounded `deleteProjectBatch` calls hard-delete messages, sessions, goals, and progress events before hard-deleting the project. The batch is safe to retry and rejects a project that was not first soft-deleted by its owner. No document data exists in S04; S08/S10 must extend the same protocol explicitly for documents, jobs, chunks, and citations.

The v2 marker is installed by the resumable `bootstrapSchemaV2` migration. It has no backfill because v1 has no business rows; rollback means redeploying the compatible v1 release only before v2 functions are in use, while a populated v2 deployment must remain on a compatible release until a separately tested migration exists.

## Deployment and secrets boundary

`packages/api/.env.local` is local-only and ignored by the root `.gitignore`; `packages/api/.env.example` is the committed empty template. Convex CLI writes development coordinates locally. Production is separately selected and explicitly deployed with `convex deploy` only when separately authorized; development variables do not become production variables. Deployment-admin credentials and provider keys are server-side per deployment and never imported by `packages/app` or exposed through `VITE_*` values.

## Plan and operational limits

The selected plan is **Convex Free**, never metered Starter. Checked limits: 0.5 GB database, 1 GB/month database I/O, 1 GB file storage, 1 GB/month data egress, 0.5 GB search storage, 3,000 query-GB/month search and 1 million function calls/month. Reconfirm actual plan and current limits at any authorized provisioning/deployment; quota exhaustion must fail visibly and must not trigger paid upgrade. Roll back a failed release by redeploying the previous compatible commit; do not downgrade a populated schema until data compatibility is assessed.
